## 🧩 About

Mizo is a real-time gesture and action recognition system powered by **MediaPipe Holistic**, **TensorFlow LSTM**, and **OpenCV**. It extracts **1,662 body keypoints per frame** — covering pose, face, and both hands — sequences them over 60 frames, and feeds them through a stacked LSTM network to classify what action is being performed — all live through your webcam.

> ⚡ Built to be extended — add your own gestures or sign language vocabulary by simply updating the `actions` array and re-collecting data.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📷 **Live webcam feed** with styled, colour-coded landmark overlays
- 🦴 **Full-body keypoint extraction** — pose (132), face (1404), left hand (63), right hand (63)
- 🧠 **Stacked LSTM model** trained on custom action sequences
- 📊 **TensorBoard integration** for real-time training visualisation
- ⏱️ **Early stopping** with best-weight restoration to prevent overfitting
- 🔢 **On-screen confidence bars** per action with a tunable threshold
- 💾 **Model & scaler persistence** via `.h5` and `.pkl` files for reproducible inference

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.9+**
- A working **webcam**
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or JupyterLab

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DandarGaming/Mizo
cd mizo
```

**2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

**3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python mediapipe scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### Running the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook mizo.ipynb
```

> ⚠️ **Always run Cell 1 first** every time you open the notebook — it imports all required libraries.

Then follow the numbered sections **1 → 11** in order.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Keypoint Extraction
MediaPipe Holistic detects landmarks across the full body each frame. These are flattened into a single vector of **1,662 values**:

| Region | Landmarks | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Pose | 33 | 132 (x, y, z, visibility) |
| Face | 468 | 1404 (x, y, z) |
| Left Hand | 21 | 63 (x, y, z) |
| Right Hand | 21 | 63 (x, y, z) |
| **Total** | | **1,662** |

### 2. Data Collection
For each action in the `actions` array, the system records **60 sequences × 60 frames**. Keypoints for each frame are saved as `.npy` files under `MP_Data/`.

### 3. Preprocessing
- Keypoints are normalised with `StandardScaler` (fit on training data only)
- The fitted scaler is saved to `scaler.pkl` — **required at inference time**
- Labels are one-hot encoded with `to_categorical`

### 4. Training
The LSTM model trains for up to **2,000 epochs** with early stopping (`patience=50`) monitoring validation loss, automatically restoring the best weights.

### 5. Real-Time Inference
The live detection loop:
1. Captures a frame from the webcam
2. Extracts and scales keypoints using the saved scaler
3. Appends to a rolling **60-frame window**
4. Runs a prediction once the window is full
5. Displays confidence bars and the recognised action sentence on screen

> Press **`x`** at any time to exit the live feed gracefully.
> > Press **`p`** at any time to pause the live feed .

## 🖥️ Usage

### Defining Actions
Edit the `actions` array in **Section 4** to include any gestures or signs you want to recognise:

```python
actions = np.array(["hello", "thanks", "yes", "no"])  # customise freely
```

### Monitoring Training with TensorBoard

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=Logs
```
Then open `http://localhost:6006` in your browser.

### Saving & Loading the Model

```python
# Save
model.save("Mizo.h5")

# Load full model
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model("Mizo.h5")

# Load weights only (emergency recovery)
model.load_weights("Mizo.h5")
```

### Tuning the Confidence Threshold

```python
threshold = 0.5  # raise for stricter predictions, lower for more sensitivity
```

---

## 📈 Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model with:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import multilabel_confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

yhat  = model.predict(X_test)
ytrue = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1).tolist()
yhat  = np.argmax(yhat,   axis=1).tolist()

multilabel_confusion_matrix(ytrue, yhat)  # per-class TP/FP/TN/FN breakdown
accuracy_score(ytrue, yhat)               # overall accuracy
```
